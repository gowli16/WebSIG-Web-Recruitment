1. what is flex box

   flex box is a layout model used in CSS for structured rows and columns.
   The properties of flexbox enables smooth designs and easy positioning

2. Why is CSS hard?

   From my experience CSS isnt difficult but there are lots of properties
   to know and memorize other than that the concept of flexbox seems easy
   but implementing the idea takes a lot of time. If the properties of
   flexbox aren't used properly then the whole layout of your website
   becomes messed up.

3. What is one thing that finally 'clicked'?

   I thought that we could replace flexbox with positioning and
   tables to create a grid of sorts. But flexbox is more than that
   the unique properties that it possesses such as order, justify-content,gap
   flex-wrap, align-items, makes the alignment process so much easier


challenges i faced

when i first started using flexbox i couldnt get the text to come infront of the images
and like the positioning was a mess. One small line of code ruiend the whole layout. I didnt
know how to position the items without using position:relative and absolute.
