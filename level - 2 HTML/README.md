HTML is the base of every website the structure of your desired website depends on the HTML structure
in other words its like the blueprint when building a building

The div tag is a division or section that creates a separate section in your html page 
this division is used as a container for HTMl elements such as headings, tables , images etc
The elements contained in a div tag is uncertain there are endless possibilities as to what the 
div tag can contain
Semantic tags are predefined tags one such tag is heading (h1) this tag has one specific meaning 
and can only contain a heading. The elements contained inside the semantic tags are definite and
from the tag itself its clear what the function of the tag is.

My website contains information about the Hersheys Californian Almond bites I used some inline CSS for 
the color and positioning as well as the basic HTML tags. Since I did not use bootstrap there are some
allignment issues when switching to another device. 

Challenges I faced

- Not using AI : i realised that i am very dependant on AI and using google to find the exact answer
  that i wanted proved to be difficult. With AI it gives the exact portion that i need but searching
  manually takes more time and effort

- I had issues with the footer tag and i had difficulty integrating it into the website
- I also had some issues with the table as it didnt fit into the theme of my website
