Git is a free and open-source system which allows you to track your changes, edit, and delete them
Using Git is helpful for team projects and to share your code with the rest of the world. You can
manage different versions of your code and go back to the previous version if needed. Git also 
records the changes that you create and can undo them if you wish to.


Github is a platform where you can upload your code into something called a repository and you can 
upload your code there for other people to see share and edit. Here you can work with others and 
collaborate on projects

I think the reason why developers use this platform is because it is user friendly and many users
can collaborate under a single project. It also tracks your changes and you can undo the changes if 
you want to. You can also create a new branch with your updated code so that the original code stays 
safe.


CHALLENGES I FACED

- Without the use of AI it was difficult to find the proper commands on gitbash to create a repository
  and link it to the one on github

- I struggled to create the readme file inside the level 1 folder when i created it the file would always
- appear outside the level 1 folder.
